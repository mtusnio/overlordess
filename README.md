### Compilation
Microsoft Visual Express 2010 is needed for compilation, use Overlord.sln. Modify project to change OutputDirectory to your desired path. If debug fails, compile in release mode.

In case of problems check Valve developer wiki first - https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Compiling_under_VS2010

### Mapsrc

Mapsrc folder contains files to use with Hammer map editor, both .vmf files and an .fgd file. Unfortunately, as of now no config for SourceSDK is available. However, when creating one make sure to use Source 2007 template and base it on HL2DM config.
